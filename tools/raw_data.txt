"Injured person was sleeping when he felt a stinging sensation on his right thigh area. The injured person was not concerned at the time. The bitten area became inflamed and red of the next few days. The injured person attended the Camp Medical Centre on the 26th November when he became concerned about possible infection as the wound was now painful. Sequence of events After arriving on-site on the 14th November, IP was working within the  area. Daily tasks included working with the Geo-mesh fabric consisting of 14 rolls, which has been situated within the area for approx. 3 months. The task required handling of the Geo-mesh fabric to be used in the  drains. Geo-mesh was handled by IP on multiple occasions over the course of their roster. The tasks were completed with the assistance. Due to the length of time that a white tail spider bite takes to manifest it is unknown an exact time, date and location the bite was incurred. After inspection of the injured person's accommodation and work areas and the knowledge that the accommodation houses had a full pest treatment including externals it is highly probable that the bite was received in the workplace. After inspecting the work place buildings toilets trucks etc. and finding no evidence of spiders the most probable location is as stated above the spider where in the geo fabric mesh utilised for the  drains."

"SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. On the morning am of the 15/08/13 a truck operator was reversing in under the excavator for another load. While the truck was still in motion in reverse, the excavator operator extended the boom with the bucket coned with heavy clay material. The part of the bucket load fell from bucket and landed in the tray of the truck. The truck driver felt that a big rock had been dropped into the truck. It was identified there was no big rock in the load just clay type material. Loading continued until completion and truck left load out area. It was the last load before meal break and the trucks tipped loads and went to fuel farm for refuelling. It was reported to the supervisor that the injured truck operator was at the fuel farm upset and reporting pain in the neck and mid back area. The supervisor alerted the medic who came and assessed the injured truck operator and treated the injury. The operator did not continue with the shift.

The excavator operator dropping the load into a reversing haul truck without warning the truck operator with horn was not identified as a hazard. Lack of communication. The truck operator was not aware of the load being dumped into tray when the truck was reversing as there was no horn signal given. Horseplay involved. From the statement from the excavator operator saying that what you get from being slow and the statement from the other truck operator watching the incident said I quote (I told you id drop a rock on you if you drove slowly). This is a yes there was horseplay involved. It was identified that there was at the time some personal conflict between truck operator and excavator operator. The Work Environment The environment was dark as it was at night. Equipment Material Issues The excavator bucket was loaded (coned was the term utilised) with wet heavy clay material and some fell from bucket when boom was extended over reversing truck. For the amount of material to fall off the bucket without intentionally dumping the load would indicate it was overloaded. Right hand mirror was cracked as identified in the attached prestart and made it difficult to see when reversing. Mirror had been identified in prestart on the 14/08/13 and new mirror had been ordered to be replaced. Procedure Work Method The task requires a standard operating procedure.  Loading Haul Truck Procedure attached. However from the statements provided it was identified as not followed by the excavator operator. The Excavator operator dropped a load into the tray of the reversing haul truck and did not communicate via radio or horn to signal the operator of the truck to stop and brace to receive load. Organisational Factors It is evident from the investigation that the two persons had personal issues associated with working together and management personnel did not identify and manage the situation. BASIC ROOT CAUSE No communication by radio or horn to signal the operator of the truck to stop and brace to receive load."
